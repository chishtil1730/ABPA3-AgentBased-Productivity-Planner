# 🧠 Internal Docs: ABPA3

Documentation of the technical decisions, troubleshooting steps, and architectural "eureka" moments encountered while building ABPA3.

### 🔍 Inside this Folder

* **✍️ Handwritten Dev Diary:** Scanned or transcribed raw notes and conceptual sketches written during active development sessions.
* **🐞 The Bug Vault:** Detailed post-mortems and fixes for browser, CORS, and system-level hurdles.
* **⚖️ Decision Logs:** The logic behind architectural trade-offs—why choice A was preferred over choice B.
* **🛠️ Workarounds:** Deep dives into overcoming technical constraints like audio latency and hardware limitations.

**Goal:** To provide a transparent look at the engineering process—not just the final code, but the raw logic and handwritten ideas that built it.
