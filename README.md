## ✨ What is ABPA3?

ABPA3 is an experimental productivity system built around **agent-based automation** and **visual-first thinking**.

Instead of juggling disconnected tools, ABPA3 brings together:
- Visual flowcharts for thinking
- Kanban boards for execution
- Calendar-aware actions
- A fully local voice assistant

All inside a single, cohesive workspace.
